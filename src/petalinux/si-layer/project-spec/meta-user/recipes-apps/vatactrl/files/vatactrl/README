This package is designed as a sample GNU build, to
learn GNU auto* tools and procedures.  It is
adapted from the "Learning the GNU development tools",
written by Eleftherios Gkioulekas.  This tutorial can
be found at:
  http://autotoolset.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html

The README file contains the information an experienced
developer needs to know about the package in general
and any special steps on how to build and/or configure it.
(New developers should read the standard INSTALL file,
and run "./configure --help" to see which options are
available.)

This package produces a simple hello world program.
You can build it the usual way:
    ./configure
    make
    make install
(It is suggested you use the "--prefix" option to
configure to install in your home directory, like this:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/rkakarla
