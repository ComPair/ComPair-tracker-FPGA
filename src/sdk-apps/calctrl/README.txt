This is the calctrl application to build the calctrl command line tool.

This is a cludge, until we can get the fucking thing building via petalinux

This does seem to work at least...

To build this, you will need to create a new c++ application, and rename
main.cc to calctrl.cpp, then copy this source into the sdk application's
source directory.
