The timing diagrams are generated using WaveDrom (www.wavedrom.com).
You can just generate these using the online editor so nothing needs to be downloaded. 

Currently the diagrams form VATA460.3 are present in the folder. 
The source code has the same file name but with *.txt extension.


Cheers,
Sam
